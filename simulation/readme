In this repository:
1. Python simulator which can do planning, control and replay past logs
2. Main trajectory planning algorithm (trajectory.py)


## Setting up for MPC 

To build the MPC controller (you need to do this everytime you change something in controllers.py)

```python3 controllers.py```

This should createa folder called `c_generated_code` which has the gen code that acados will need for compilation. The `libacados_ocp_solver_particle_ode.so` is the main library for this.
